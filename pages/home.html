   <div class="blurb"><p>Hello. My name is Sid Kumar, and I am the president of Computer Club for the 2021-22 school year. Computer Club is a place where people who are interested in computer related topics can gather and learn more about those topics amongst like-minded people. The club is split into groups that each have a focus on a different area of computer science, where each week the group lead has a lesson on a topic in that interest area.
